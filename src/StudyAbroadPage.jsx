              Understand Culture:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Studying abroad allows you get to know another culture first-hand.
              There are a lot of cultural differences apart from language, food,
              appearances, and personal habits which reflects a person's deep
              perceptions, beliefs, and values that influence his or her way of
              life and the way that she/he views the world. Going to a different
              country gives you the opportunity to understand the cultural
              differences at a very young age and helps you adapt to such
              differences.
            </p>
            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">Make New Friends:</h3>
            <p>
              By going abroad to study at a young age, you can easily make
              friends around the world and improve your network. This may help
              you enormously in building your contacts and helps you grow in
              your career path
            </p>
            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">Discover Yourself: </h3>
            <p>
              You may develop skills and experiences a classroom setting will
              never provide. Even though you may find it a little scary to go &
              live in a new country with lot of cultural & lifestyle
              differences, over a period of time you will learn that it is also
              more exciting. It's an opportunity to discover new strengths and
              abilities, conquer new challenges, and solve new problems. You
              will encounter situations that are wholly unfamiliar to you and
              will learn to adapt and respond in effective ways.
            </p>
            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">Expands your worldview: </h3>
            <p>
              As a student & a Citizen who has not travelled much beyond the
              nation's boundary, you tend to develop some fixed opinions about
              the people in other countries. Students who study abroad return
              home with an informed and much less biased perspective toward
              other cultures and peoples.
            </p>
            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">
              Improves your employment opportunities:
            </h3>
            <p>
              An employer feels that a student who has studied abroad is
              self-motivated, independent, willing to embrace challenges, and
              able to cope with diverse problems and situations. Your experience
              living and studying in a foreign country, negotiating another
              culture, and acquiring another language will all set you apart
              from the majority of other job applicants.

            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">
              Study abroad helps you to learn about yourself:
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Overseas study & living in a foreign land for a substantial
              amount of time helps one develop new ideas and perspectives about
              oneself and your own culture. This also helps you to reconsider
              your own beliefs and values. This experience may strengthen those
              values or it may cause students to alter or abandon them and
              embrace new concepts and perceptions.
            </p>
            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">

              academic routine:
            </h3>
            <p>
              As a student you may be used to a particular way of teaching. You
              may be experiencing a completely unfamiliar & interesting academic
              system. You will also have the chance to take courses not offered
              in your country. This also gives you a great opportunity to break
              out the monotony of the routine you would have followed every year
              in India.
            </p>
            <h3 className="whyAbraodSideHeader">Learn a new language:</h3>

              depending on the country you go to. You're surrounded by the
              language on a daily basis and are seeing and hearing it in the
              proper cultural context. Language learning happens most quickly
              under these circumstances.

                Deciding where to study is just as important as choosing a study
                abroad program, and it depends on very personal factors.
                Different factors are important to different people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the choice of your course or program, you may
                choose the country. There are some courses that are special in
                certain countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some countries allow students to gain work experience after the
                completion of the education. So if you are looking at some
                international work exposure, then you can choose them
                accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some courses in certain countries have an integrated work option
                during your regular college curriculum. This gives you an
                opportunity to interact with the industry and also gain little
                bit of work experience and understanding of the work culture in
                these countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                If closely integrating the experience with your degree is
                important to you, then you should consider a location that
                offers courses in your major and has natural affinities to your
                major that will afford you experiences in your field of interest
                outside the classrrom, too.

              <p>
                Developing nations are playing an increasing role in the global
                economy. Also remember that while large cities offer numerous
                social and intellectual opportunities, they are also more
                cosmopolitan. Your extracurricular options may seem more limited
                in a smaller town, but it's there that you will gain more of an
                appreciation of traditional ways of life and make connections
                with the natives.

                  your course selection with destinations offering unique
                  programs in your field.

                <li>
                  <span>Work Experience:</span>
                  Consider countries with post-graduation work opportunities or
                  programs with integrated work placements for practical
                  experience and cultural understanding of the work environment.

                <li>
                  <span>Cultural Integration:</span>
                  Look for locations that offer experiences related to your
                  major outside of the classroom, especially in developing
                  nations for a deeper immersion in a growing global economy.

                  Large cities provide a vibrant social and intellectual scene

                  Understand how the program choice is relevant toward your

                </li>
                <li>
                  Analyse if the program would give you the opportunity to take
                  courses you might not otherwise have the opportunity to take
                  in India.
                </li>
